<!--## 2. Pitching, Pair Formation, Wireframing - DAN, BRAUS 10/24
  - **Objectives** -
    - Identify design best practices used in existing apps
    - Articulate wireframing best practices and benefits
    - Create a wireframe for your app
  - **In Class Activities** -
    -  *Product Pitches* - Students will pitch their product idea (both verbally and through text) and self select into partner pairs. This is a great exercise to practice persuasive communication.
    - *Teamwork skills diagnostic* - Students will fill out the "individual performance" teamwork rubric. This rubric helps you self-evaluate your teamwork related skills. Using the rubric, you can discuss with your partner your strengths and weaknesses as a team. This activity helps you  identify how you can grow individually and together.
    -  *Draft User Journey and Wireframe* - Create a [Wireframe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ALBDn3bIycimyvnB6fEOAMadDOCA4wmoOO9Z-lpBRsM/edit#slide=id.p) and [User Journey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UKVsUOCxQPNT3P42cvsTYxhNl7lpsDHjJew_a5K1JaM/edit#slide=id.g16bb89fe2b_0_72) for your app. As we learned last term (see slides in links to the left), it's critical to user test this wireframe to ensure that it is intuitive and meets user needs.
    - *Create a draft Medium.com article* - this article is where you will take notes on your product creation journey that will eventually become a blog post.
  - **After Class** - 1) conduct user interviews for your idea 2) get feedback on your wireframe by "testing it" with potential users
