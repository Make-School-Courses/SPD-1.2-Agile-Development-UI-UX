    - *Teacher Talk: Into to User Experience & User Testing*
    - *Redesigning the Clipper Card Site* - Apply what you learned in the teacher talk to redesign the Clipper Card site
    - *Giving & Recieving Feedback Challenge* - So far, we've mostly build products by ourselves. Now we are introducing a critical component to professional development: giving an recieving feedback from peers. While giving feedback may seem simple, masterful delivery of feedback results in the recipient feeling inspired, encouraged, and a sense of ownership over their work. We'll practice giving and recieving feedback on our wireframes and also cover the most time-efficient ways to ask for help. This skill builds off of the previous professional communication content from the previous term and will build into the teamwork curriculum in term 3.
    - *Paper Prototyping and Testing* Students mock up projects with paper and test with users. Building apps with paper is fast, easy and allows for fast ideation. 
  - **After Class** - give and get feedback on your wireframe from two peers, and two people who are NOT Make School students. Test with people who are in your target demographic and have not seen your app yet.
