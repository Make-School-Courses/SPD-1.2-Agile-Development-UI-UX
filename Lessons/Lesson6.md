    - *Sprint Retrospectives* - Each Sprint ends with a "Sprint Retrospective" in which teammates reflect on their previous sprint's performance, discuss any team issues that arose, and add new "tickets" to the backlog. You can think of "Sprint Planning" as deciding what to build and the "Sprint Retrospective" as reflecting on how the team can collaborate better.
    - *Sprint 2 Planning* - Time to plan your next sprint with your partner!
  - **After Class** - 1) execute your sprint with your project partner, 2) send an email to reach out to an industry contact for feedback on your product, advice on how to be a successful engineer. You can schedule a call or meet in person.
