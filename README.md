# SPD 1.2 Agile Development & UI/UX

## Course Description

Term two focuses on the foundational skills of successful engineering teams. In pairs, you and your partner will together build an app using “lean product development” methodology, the industry standard for engineering team collaboration. You'll learn SCRUM planning, an agile process used to ensure that your app meets user needs and technical specifications. 

This class also covers how to make a seamless user experience (UX) based on an effective user interface (UI). We utilize design concepts inherent in the world’s most popular apps: information hierarchy, system state, grid systems, onboarding teardowns, typography and color. By the end you and your partner will ship a beautiful app that delights users.

## Why you should know this (optional)

Beautifully designed apps are a critical part of your portfolio - recruiters often notice design first and then look at the backend. Whether or not you end up becoming a front end developer, the tools you'll use in this course will give you the language to interface with design teams, understand user psychology, and practices to creating exceptional products.

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
